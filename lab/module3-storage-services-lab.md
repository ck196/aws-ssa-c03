5. **Upload a File - Version 1**
   - Go to the "Objects" tab of your bucket
   - Click "Upload"
   - Click "Add files" and select a text file from your computer
     - If you don't have one, create a simple text file with content "This is version 1"
   - Leave all default settings
   - Click "Upload"

6. **Modify and Upload the Same File - Version 2**
   - On your local computer, open the text file you just uploaded
   - Modify its content (e.g., change it to "This is version 2")
   - Save the file
   - In the S3 console, click "Upload" again
   - Click "Add files" and select the same text file
   - Click "Upload"

7. **Modify and Upload the Same File - Version 3**
   - Repeat the process to create and upload a third version

   - Open each downloaded file to confirm they contain the correct content

10. **Restore a Previous Version**
    - In the versions list, select version 1
    - Click "Download"
    - On your local computer, save this as a new file
    - Upload this file to the S3 bucket (creating version 4)
    - Alternatively, you can make a copy of the older version by selecting it and using "Copy"

11. **Delete a Version**
    - In the versions list, select one of the versions
    - Click "Delete"
    - Confirm the deletion by typing "permanently delete" in the confirmation field
    - Click "Delete"
    - Notice that other versions remain intact

12. **Enable MFA Delete (Optional, requires MFA device)**
    - This step requires AWS CLI and an MFA device
    - Configure AWS CLI with your credentials
    - Run:
      ```
      aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-unique-bucket-name-12345 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn-of-mfa-device mfa-code"
      ```

13. **Clean Up (Optional)**
    - If you want to delete the bucket:
    - Go to the bucket's "Objects" tab
    - Click "Empty"
    - Type "permanently delete" to confirm

   - Ensure at least one file is larger than 128KB (for S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
   - Click "Upload"

3. **Create a Lifecycle Rule**
   - In your bucket, go to the "Management" tab
   - Scroll down to "Lifecycle rules"
   - Click "Create lifecycle rule"

4. **Configure Basic Settings**
   - Enter a name for the rule (e.g., "TestLifecycleRule")
   - Under "Rule scope", choose whether to apply this rule to all objects or specific objects
   - If you want to apply to specific objects, you can use a prefix (e.g., "test/") or specific tags
   - Click "Next"

5. **Configure Lifecycle Rule Actions**
   - Select "Transition current versions of objects between storage classes"
   - Configure the following transitions:
     - Standard to Standard-IA: 30 days after object creation
     - Standard-IA to Glacier: 60 days after object creation
     - Glacier to Glacier Deep Archive: 180 days after object creation
   - You can also select "Expire current versions of objects" and set it to 365 days
   - Click "Next"

6. **Review and Create**
   - Review your lifecycle rule settings
   - Click "Create rule"

7. **Test the Lifecycle Rule (Simulated)**

- Two EC2 instances running in the same VPC (use Module 2, Exercise 1 to create them)
- Ensure they're in the same security group or that their security groups have the same rules

### Steps

1. **Create a Security Group for EFS**
   - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to EC2
   - In the left navigation pane, click "Security Groups"
   - Click "Create security group"
   - Enter a name (e.g., "EFS-SG")
   - Add a description
   - Select your VPC
   - Add an inbound rule:
     - Type: NFS
     - Source: Select the security group of your EC2 instances
   - Click "Create security group"

2. **Create an EFS File System**
   - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to EFS
   - Click "Create file system"
   - Step 1 (Configure file system access):
     - Select your VPC
     - For mount targets, select all Availability Zones where your EC2 instances are running
     - For each mount target, select the EFS security group you created
     - Click "Next"
   - Step 2 (Configure optional settings):
     - Enter a name for your file system
     - Keep default settings for performance mode and throughput mode
     - Click "Next"
   - Step 3 (Review and create):
     - Review your settings
     - Click "Create"

3. **Prepare Your EC2 Instances**
   - Connect to both EC2 instances using SSH
   - On each instance, install the NFS client:
     ```
     sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
     ```
   - Create a mount point on each instance:
     ```
     sudo mkdir /efs
     ```

4. **Mount the EFS File System on Both Instances**
   - In the EFS console, select your file system
   - Click "Attach"
   - Copy the mount command from the "Mount via DNS" section
   - On each EC2 instance, run the mount command:
     ```
     sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-xxxxxxxx.efs.region.amazonaws.com:/ /efs
     ```
     (Replace the actual values with those from your copied command)
   - Check that the mount was successful:
     ```
     df -h
     ```

5. **Configure Automatic Mounting on Reboot**
   - On each instance, edit the fstab file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/fstab
     ```
   - Add the following line:
     ```
     fs-xxxxxxxx.efs.region.amazonaws.com:/ /efs nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport 0 0
     ```
     (Replace with your actual file system details)
   - Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

6. **Test File Sharing Between Instances**
   - On Instance 1, create a file in the EFS mount:
     ```
     echo "This file was created on Instance 1" | sudo tee /efs/test-file.txt
     sudo chmod 666 /efs/test-file.txt
     ```
   - On Instance 2, verify you can see and modify the file:
     ```
     cat /efs/test-file.txt
     echo "This line was added on Instance 2" >> /efs/test-file.txt
     ```
   - Return to Instance 1 and check the updated file:
     ```
     cat /efs/test-file.txt
     ```
   - You should see both lines, demonstrating that both instances are sharing the same file system

7. **Test Performance (Optional)**
   - Create a large file on the EFS mount to test performance:
     ```
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/efs/test-file bs=1M count=1024
     ```
   - Read the file to test read performance:
     ```
     dd if=/efs/test-file of=/dev/null bs=1M
     ```

8. **Clean Up (Optional)**
   - Unmount the EFS file system from both instances:
     ```
     sudo umount /efs
     ```
   - Remove the entry from /etc/fstab on both instances
   - In the EFS console, select your file system
   - Click "Delete"
   - Type the file system ID to confirm
   - Click "Confirm"
   - In the EC2 console, delete the EFS security group
