# AWS Cost Management and Optimization

This module covers AWS cost management strategies, tools, and best practices to help you optimize your AWS spending while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Understanding AWS Pricing Models

### 1. Compute Pricing Models

#### EC2 Instance Pricing
- **On-Demand Instances**: Pay by the hour or second with no long-term commitment
- **Reserved Instances**: 1-3 year commitment for significant discounts (up to 75%)
- **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount
- **Savings Plans**: Flexible pricing model for consistent usage

#### Serverless Pricing
- **AWS Lambda**: Pay per request and compute time
- **AWS Fargate**: Pay for vCPU and memory resources used
- **API Gateway**: Pay per request and data transfer

### 2. Storage Pricing Models

#### Amazon S3 Storage Classes
- **S3 Standard**: For frequently accessed data
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatic cost optimization
- **S3 Standard-IA**: For infrequently accessed data
- **S3 One Zone-IA**: For re-creatable data
- **S3 Glacier**: For archival data
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: For long-term archival

#### EBS Volume Types
- **General Purpose (gp3)**: Balanced price/performance
- **Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2)**: High performance
- **Throughput Optimized (st1)**: Low-cost HDD
- **Cold HDD (sc1)**: Lowest cost HDD
